## Course material
The basics are based on this freely available [book](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman. I also recommend [Murphy's recent book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/machine-learning-0).

For practical illustrations, I rely a lot on @jakevdp's [scikit-learn tutorial](https://github.com/jakevdp/sklearn_scipy2013
).

## TNE instructions
Download the `TNE` directory, cd to `TNE/Code`, and run

`jupyter notebook startingKit.ipynb`

to see what the practical is about. Read and execute all cells to get started. There are questions in the text and exercises at the end of the notebook.
